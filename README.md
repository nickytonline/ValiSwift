# ValiSwift

This project is a work in progress port of the JavaScript library [Valibot](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot) to Swift.


## Installation

To get started with ValiSwift, make sure you have the latest version of Swift installed. The best way to get set up with Swift is to see their [Getting Started guide](https://www.swift.org/getting-started/).

The project is set up to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), not XCode. This is so anyone will be able to contribute to the project, regardless of operating system. You can use XCode if you prefer on macOS, but the project is not set up to use it.

The project uses swift-format for formatting the code. See the [installation instructions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.vscode-apple-swift-format#global-installation) from the VS Code extension the project uses, apple-swift-format.

## Running the project

To run the project, you can use the following command:

```bash
swift test
```

This will run the tests in the project and output the results to the console.
